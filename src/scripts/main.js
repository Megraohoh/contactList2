// In main.js, import the ContactList component and the ContactForm component.
const dataLoad = require("./contactCollection")
const addContacts = require("./contact")

//dataLoad.saveData(addContacts("Megara", "Greece", "XVI"), "Contacts")  --> this line was to test to make sure information is being captured in local storage
